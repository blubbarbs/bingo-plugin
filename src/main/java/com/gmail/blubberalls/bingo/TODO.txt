Change logic for capturable goals:
    > Upon a possible completion:
            1. Check the current completor. Do they still fulfill the criteria for "staying on top"? If yes, ignore and keep them at the top
            2. Check the team that just had their completion update. Do THEY fulfill the criteria for staying on top? If yes, make them the new completors
Possible adding of multiple lines of information on sidebar per goal
